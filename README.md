## Server
The server is a Python Flask application.

_I chose flask because I prefer Python over JavaScript_

### Database
This application uses sqlite as the database, you need to first initialize the database.
for the application to work properly

Initialize the database by running `python3 db/init_db.py`

_I chose sqlite because it is lightweight and is easy to access with python/flask_

## Client

_I ended up going with React because I have heard it is the de facto client framework and I need to learn it better in order to work in the field._
